The rules are simple: you have `N` dice;  you throw them `M` times; if the sum of all your dice in all throws is bigger than `S`, you win. For example, if `N=3`, `M=2`, and `S=20`, it means that you have N=3 dice that you are allowed to throw M=2 times, and you win if all your points add up to at least S=20. \n",
